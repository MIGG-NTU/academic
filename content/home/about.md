Mathematical Imaging and Geophysics Group (MIG) is primarily focused on developing advanced mathematical tools to better image the interior of the Earth at a variety of scales, namely, from the global map of the crust and mantle to the detailed subsurface structure of a hydrocarbon/geothermal reservoir. Through developing novel mathematical modelling tools and the state-of-the-art seismic imaging technology, analyzing the full waveform contents of high-quality seismic data, and relying on high performance computing, we aim to gain insight into the geodynamic processes of the Earth's interior and provide advanced methods to solve realistic problems faced by modern oil-and-gas Exploration/Production companies and contractors.
