abstract: <p>Adjoint tomography is one of state-of-the-art imaging methods with high
  resolution. It can get better-resolved models by solving full wave equations to
  accurately simulate the propagation of seismic waves, and by considering full waveform
  information in inversion. However, the computational cost and storage requirement
  of 3-D adjoint tomography are high. Relatively, 2-D adjoint tomography is much more
  computationally efficient. Surface waves and teleseismic body waves provide essential
  data for studying crustal and uppermost mantle structures. Due to different sensitivities
  to shear wave velocity at depths and Moho discontinuity, joint inversion of both
  datasets can resolve the Vs model and Moho interface better. To take advantages
  of the two different types of data, we propose a strategy of joint inversion for
  ambient noise surface waves and teleseismic body waves recorded by linear arrays
  based on the adjoint-state method, which can be used to yield a fine Vs model and
  Moho topography. We perform various synthetic imaging experiments, in which the
  model has typical features of crustal structures in North China Craton (NCC). Compared
  to the surface wave inversion only, joint inversion improves the resolution of images
  as well as constraining discontinuity undulations better. Compared to the body wave
  inversion only, joint inversion can suppress high frequency artifacts and reduce
  the nonlinearity during inversion. This study could provide an efficient alternative
  to image fine velocity structures beneath linear arrays and also build a framework
  for joint inversion. It could improve the resolution of lithospheric imaging and
  also provide strategies of incorporating other waveforms in the future.</p>
