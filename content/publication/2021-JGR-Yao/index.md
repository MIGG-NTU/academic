abstract: Abstract The intermediate-depth (50–180 km) seismicity beneath Myanmar provides
  direct evidence of the subducting Indian slab. However, the historic lack of regional
  seismic observations leads to previous low-resolution models that show large variations
  in slab geometry beneath Myanmar. The depth extent and morphology of the slab are
  still poorly known. In this study, we conduct a joint inversion of regional and
  teleseismic P-wave traveltimes from recently installed networks to image seismic
  velocity structures beneath central Myanmar by adopting an eikonal equation-based
  traveltime tomography method. The observations contain a total of 6,069 regional
  first P-wave arrivals and 29,787 teleseismic P-wave differential traveltimes. We
  find a high P-wave velocity anomaly beneath central Myanmar, which starts from ∼50 km
  depth and extends continuously to the mantle transition zone (MTZ) and is interpreted
  as the subducting Indian slab. Below 100 km depth, the dip angle of the slab in
  the south is ∼15° larger than that of the slab in the north, suggesting a possible
  slab tearing. Based on our tomographic results and previous studies, the slab in
  the north is inferred to have a deep stagnant segment lying above the 660-km discontinuity
  in the MTZ, but whether it is connected with the shallow dipping slab cannot be
  confirmed. Meanwhile, the slab in the south may just stay in the upper mantle (above
  410 km), but it may also have penetrated the 410-km discontinuity. Taking into account
  all the scenarios, we propose four possible models of the Indian Plate subduction
  system beneath central Myanmar.
