abstract: Delineating spatial variations of seismic anisotropy in the crust is of
  great importance for the understanding of structural heterogeneities, regional stress
  regime and ongoing crustal dynamics. In this study, we present a 3-D anisotropic
  P-wave velocity model of the crust beneath northern California by using the eikonal
  equation-based seismic azimuthal anisotropy tomography method. The velocity heterogeneities
  under different geological units are well resolved. The thickness of the low-velocity
  sediment at the Great Valley Sequence is estimated to be about 10 km. The high-velocity
  anomaly underlying Great Valley probably indicates the existence of ophiolite bodies.
  Strong velocity contrasts are revealed across the Hayward Fault (2–9 km) and San
  Andreas Fault (2–12 km). In the upper crust (2–9 km), the fast velocity directions
  (FVDs) are generally fault-parallel in the northern Coast Range, which may be caused
  by geological structure; while the FVDs are mainly NE–SW in Great Valley and the
  northern Sierra Nevada possibly due to the regional maximum horizontal compressive
  stress. In contrast, seismic anisotropy in the mid-lower crust (12–22 km) may be
  attributed to the alignment of mica schists. The anisotropy contrast across the
  San Andreas Fault may imply different mechanisms of crustal deformation on the two
  sides of the fault. Both the strong velocity contrasts and the high angle (∼45°
  or above) between the FVDs and the strikes of faults suggest that the faults are
  mechanically weak in the San Francisco bay area (2–6 km). This study suggests that
  the eikonal equation-based seismic azimuthal anisotropy tomography is a valuable
  tool to investigate crustal heterogeneities and tectonic deformation.
