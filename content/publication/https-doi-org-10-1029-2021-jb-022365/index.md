abstract: Abstract Seismic anisotropy provides crucial information on the stress state
  and geodynamic processes inside the Earth. We develop a novel adjoint-state traveltime
  tomography method using P-wave traveltime data to simultaneously determine velocity
  heterogeneity and azimuthal anisotropy of the subsurface. First, an anisotropic
  eikonal equation is derived to model first-arrival traveltimes in azimuthally anisotropic
  media. Traveltime tomography is then formulated as an optimization problem constrained
  by the anisotropic eikonal equation, which is subsequently solved by the adjoint-state
  method. Ray tracing is not required. Its high accuracy is achieved by solving the
  anisotropic eikonal equation and the associated adjoint equation with efficient
  numerical solvers. In addition, an eikonal equation-based earthquake location method
  for azimuthally anisotropic media is developed to solve the coupled hypocenter-velocity
  problem. The tomography and earthquake location methods are applied to central California
  near Parkfield to test their performance in practice. A total of 1,068,850 first
  P-wave traveltimes clearly maps the velocity heterogeneity and azimuthal anisotropy
  in the upper and middle crust. The average P-wave velocity model shows a striking
  velocity contrast across the San Andreas Fault (SAF). In the upper crust, we find
  structural anisotropy in the SAF zone and stress-induced anisotropy off the SAF
  zone. In the middle crust, the fast P-wave velocity directions are generally fault-parallel
  due to the decreased effect of the maximum horizontal compressive stress. In all,
  the real-data application suggests that the new adjoint-state traveltime tomography
  method can be reliably used to investigate anisotropic seismic structures.
