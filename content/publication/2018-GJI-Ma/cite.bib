    abstract = "{We develop a new time-space optimized symplectic (TSOS) method for numerically solving elastic wave equations in heterogeneous isotropic media. We use the phase-preserving symplectic partitioned Rungeâ€“Kutta method to evaluate the time derivatives and optimized explicit finite-difference (FD) schemes to discretize the space derivatives. We introduce the averaged medium scheme into the TSOS method to further increase its capability of dealing with heterogeneous media and match the boundary-modified scheme for implementing free-surface boundary conditions and the auxiliary differential equation complex frequency-shifted perfectly matched layer (ADE CFS-PML) non-reflecting boundaries with the TSOS method. A comparison of the TSOS method with analytical solutions and standard FD schemes indicates that the waveform generated by the TSOS method is more similar to the analytic solution and has a smaller error than other FD methods, which illustrates the efficiency and accuracy of the TSOS method. Subsequently, we focus on the calculation of synthetic seismograms for teleseismic P or Swaves entering and propagating in the local heterogeneous region of interest. To improve the computational efficiency, we successfully combine the TSOS method with the frequency-wavenumber (FK) method and apply the ADE CFS-PML to absorb the scattered waves caused by the regional heterogeneity. The TSOS-FK hybrid method is benchmarked against semi-analytical solutions provided by the FK method for a 1-D layered model. Several numerical experiments, including a vertical cross-section of the Chinese capital area crustal model, illustrate that the TSOS-FK hybrid method works well for modelling waves propagating in complex heterogeneous media and remains stable for long-time computation. These numerical examples also show that the TSOS-FK method can tackle the converted and scattered waves of the teleseismic plane waves caused by local heterogeneity. Thus, the TSOS and TSOS-FK methods proposed in this study present an essential tool for the joint inversion of local, regional and teleseismic waveform data.}",
