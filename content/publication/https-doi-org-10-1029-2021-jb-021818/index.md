abstract: Abstract Ray tracing is avoidable in seismic traveltime tomography. In this
  study, seismic traveltime tomography is reformulated as an eikonal equation-constrained
  optimization problem solved by the ray-free adjoint-state method. The resultant
  approach is called adjoint-state traveltime tomography. For completeness, an eikonal
  equation-based earthquake location method is developed to locate the hypocenters
  of earthquakes when necessary. The multiple-grid model parameterization is adopted
  to discretize the relative slowness perturbation . The step-size-controlled gradient
  descent method, which has an effect of damping regularization, is used to find optimal
  earthquake hypocenters and velocity models. The performances of the earthquake location
  and adjoint-state traveltime tomography methods are tested in the source area of
  the 2020 Mw 4.9 Anza earthquake, a seismologically active place in southern California.
  The obtained high-resolution P-wave velocity model demonstrates that the 2020 Mw
  4.9 Anza earthquake and other historic moderate-sized Anza earthquakes occurred
  near or at the boundaries of low VP rocks, a typical seismogenic environment for
  moderate to large crustal earthquakes. Meanwhile, the source zone of the Anza earthquakes
  is characterized by high VP/VS, indicating the possible existence of crustal fluids
  as well as the critical role of fluids in the occurrence of those moderated-sized
  Anza earthquakes. On the whole, the well-performed eikonal equation-based earthquake
  location method and adjoint-state traveltime tomography method provide competent
  and attractive tools for hypocenter and tomographic inversions.
