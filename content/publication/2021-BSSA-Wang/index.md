abstract: Teleseismic full‐waveform inversion has recently been applied to image subwavelength‐scale
  lithospheric structures (typically a few tens of kilometers) by utilizing hybrid
  methods in which an efficient solver for the 1D background model is coupled with
  a full numerical solver for a small 3D target region. Among these hybrid methods,
  the coupling of the frequency–wavenumber technique with the spectral element method
  is one of the most computationally efficient ones. However, it is normally based
  on a single plane‐wave incidence, and thus cannot synthesize secondary global phases
  generated at interfaces outside the target area. To remedy the situation, we propose
  to use a multiple plane‐wave injection method to include secondary global phases
  in the hybrid modeling. We investigate the performance of the teleseismic full‐waveform
  inversion based on single and multiple plane‐wave incidence through an application
  in the western Pyrenees and compare it with previously published images and the
  inversion based on a global hybrid method. In addition, we also test the influence
  of Earth’s spherical curvature on the tomographic results. Our results demonstrate
  that the teleseismic full‐waveform inversion based on a single plane‐wave incidence
  can reveal complex lithospheric structures similar to those imaged using a global
  hybrid method and is reliable for practical tomography for small regions with an
  aperture of a few hundred kilometers. However, neglecting the Earth’s spherical
  curvature and secondary phases leads to errors on the recovered amplitudes of velocity
  anomalies (e.g., about 2.8% difference for density and VS, and 4.2% for VP on average).
  These errors can be reduced by adopting a spherical mesh and injecting multiple
  plane waves in the frequency–wavenumber‐based hybrid method. The proposed plane‐wave
  teleseismic full‐waveform inversion is promising for mapping subwavelength‐scale
  seismic structures using high‐frequency teleseismic body waves (&gt;1  Hz) including
  coda waves recorded at large N seismic arrays.
