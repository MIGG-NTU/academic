abstract: The absence of fine lithospheric-scale velocity models beneath Myanmar makes
  it difficult to understand the neotectonics and geodynamics along the Indo-Burma
  subduction zone. In this study, we present a high-resolution crustal and uppermost
  mantle 3-D shear-wave velocity (Vs) model of Myanmar to fill this knowledge gap,
  using ambient noise data from newly deployed seismic arrays. In the upper crust,
  our model reveals two thick (>10 km) N-S-elongated basins between the Indo-Burman
  Ranges and the Central Myanmar Basin. At middle to lower crustal depths, low velocities
  dominate the Indo-Burman Ranges, especially in its northern part where Vs is observed
  to be as low as ∼3.2 km/s in the lower crust. This feature is interpreted as sediments
  that were deposited west of the ranges and have since been subducted northeastward
  and accreted onto the overriding plate. Furthermore, our model reveals an N-S trending
  high-velocity anomaly beneath the Sagaing Fault, which could be explained by solidified
  basaltic magma that intruded upwards from the mantle where a low-velocity anomaly
  is imaged. In the upper mantle, the subducting Indian Plate is clearly imaged beneath
  Myanmar as an east-dipping high-velocity zone, overlain by a prominent wedge-shaped
  low-velocity body (Vs < 4.3 km/s). We interpret this low-velocity anomaly to represent
  partial serpentinization (19–38%) in the forearc mantle. The size and amplitude
  of this anomaly decrease towards the north, suggesting a northward reduction in
  serpentinization level within the forearc mantle, possibly related to a northward
  reduction of water in the subduction zone. This could be associated with lower water
  content in the subducting plate, as the thick sediments deposited in the north may
  have driven water out of the lowermost section, while the upper sedimentary section,
  which could still have been carrying water, would have been scraped off of the downgoing
  plate and accreted onto the overriding plate, forming part of the Indo-Burman Range.
