abstract: Abstract Adjoint tomography has been recently applied to ambient seismic
  noise and teleseismic P waves separately to unveil fine-scale lithospheric structures
  beyond the resolving ability of traditional ray-based traveltime tomography. In
  this study, we propose an inversion scheme that alternates between frequency-dependent
  traveltime inversions of ambient noise surface waves and waveform inversions of
  teleseismic P waves to take advantage of their complementary sensitivities to the
  Earth's structure. We apply our method to ambient noise empirical Green's functions
  from 60 virtual sources, direct P and scattered waves from 11 teleseismic events
  recorded by a dense linear array (∼7 km station spacing) and other regional stations
  (∼40 km average station spacing) in central California. To evaluate the performance
  of the method, we compare tomographic results from ambient noise adjoint tomography,
  full-waveform inversion of teleseismic P waves, and the alternating inversion of
  the two data sets. Both applications to practical field data sets and synthetic
  checkerboard tests demonstrate the advantage of the alternating inversion over individual
  inversions as it combines the complementary sensitivities of the two independent
  data sets toward a more unified model. The three dimensional model from our alternating
  inversion not only shows major features of velocity anomalies and discontinuities
  in agreement with previous studies, but also reveals small-scale heterogeneities
  which provide new constraints on the geometry of the Isabella Anomaly and mantle
  dynamic processes in central California. The proposed alternating inversion scheme
  can be applied to other regions with similar array deployments for high-resolution
  lithospheric imaging.
