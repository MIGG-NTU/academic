abstract: It is crucial to image the crustal velocity structure with higher resolution
  to understand the relationship between crustal seismicity and metallogenic mechanisms,
  which remain challenging targets for conventional seismic tomography. Teleseismic
  tomography via body-waves can image velocity well in the upper mantle, but poorly
  in the crust. In this study, we have developed a teleseismic full waveform inversion
  (TFWI) method based on the frequency-wavenumber spectral element method (FK-SEM)
  hybrid to improve the resolution of teleseismic P-waves in the crust. We used the
  TFWI method to study the crustal velocity by using two large teleseismic events
  recorded by 29 portable stations with ~5 km intervals across the Zhenghe-Dapu Fault
  (ZDF) in the Cathaysia Block. This is the first attempt using the FK-SEM hybrid
  on real data. As expected, we obtained a 2D velocity model in the crust that had
  high lateral resolution. There is an obvious low velocity zone (LVZ) in the crust
  below east side of the ZDF, while a relatively high velocity anomaly exits within
  its west side. Combined with previous geochemical and geological results, this LVZ
  is explained as remnant magma due to the large-scale magmatism in the Late Jurassic
  and Early Cretaceous. According to the spatial correlation among the LVZ, local
  earthquakes, faulting, and major ore deposits, we consider that seismic pumping
  might be a mechanism of thermal fluid transport for the mineralization.
