abstract: Abstract P-wave azimuthal anisotropic tomography reveals that the July 6,
  2019 Mw 7.1 Ridgecrest earthquake occurred in a region with clockwise crustal rotation.
  The rotation together with the sinistral slip on the Garlock Fault is a response
  to the northwest-trending, dextral shear within the Eastern California Shear Zone
  due to the relative motion between the Pacific and North America Plates. The hypocentral
  area of the Ridgecrest mainshock is characterized by a sharp lateral velocity contrast
  which has a reversal in contrast polarity at about 5Â km depth. We find high Vp/Vs
  ratio structures covering the rupture zones of the Mw 6.4 foreshock and the Mw 7.1
  mainshock, which may indicate the existence of fluids in the fault zones. We speculate
  that fluids and crustal rotation may have played important mechanical roles in causing
  the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence.
