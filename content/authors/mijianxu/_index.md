[Mijian Xu](https://home.xumijian.me/) joined MIG in December 2021. He is Ph.D of seismology. He has long been investigating earth inner structures in the Tibet plateau and surrounding regions. He specializes in using receiver function technique to image earth discontinuities, velocity structures and anisotropies. He is an advocate of open source and developed the [Seispy](https://seispy.xumijian.me/), SplitRFLab in seismic data processing.
