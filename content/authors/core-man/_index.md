Jiayuan Yao is a Research Fellow in Geophysics at [Nanyang Technological University](http://spms.ntu.edu.sg), cooperation with Prof. [Ping Tong](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/tongping). He received his Ph.D. degree from [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn) in 2018 advised by Prof. [Lianxing Wen](http://geophysics.geo.sunysb.edu/wen).

His research interests include the seismic structure of the Earth’s interior with special focus on the lower mantle and inner core, seismic monitoring of North Korea's nuclear tests, high-precision locations of earthquakes, and repeating earthquakes. He’s working on the project of *joint inversion of multiple seismic data in Myanmar*.
