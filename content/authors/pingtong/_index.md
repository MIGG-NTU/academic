Ping Tong joined the Division of Mathematical Sciences, School of Physical & Mathematical Sciences and Asian School of the Environment as Assistant Professor in September 2016. He comes from the Department of Geophysics at Stanford University, where he was a postdoctoral research fellow. From 2012 to 2014, he was a postdoctoral fellow of the Department of Physics at University of Toronto. He received his Ph.D. (2012) in Computational Mathematics from Tsinghua University and his B.Sc. (2007) in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Beijing Normal University in China.

Ping Tong's primary research areas are in inverse problems, numerical methods, earthquake seismology, and exploration geophysics. His primary research goal is to develop advanced mathematical modelling methods and the state-of-the-art inversion and imaging technology to better image the subsurface structures from the global to engeering scales of the interior of the earth.
