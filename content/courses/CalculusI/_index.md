# Course title, summary, and position.
linktitle: Calculus I (MH1100)
summary: The calculus is the branch of mathematics studying the rate of change of quantities (which can be interpreted as slopes of curves) and the length, area, and volume of objects. The calculus is sometimes divided into differential and integral calculus, concerned with derivatives $$ \frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}x}f(x) \quad $$ and and integrals $$ \int {f(x)} \,{\rm d}x $$ respectively. In Calculus I, we mainly discuss differential calculus and the most important concepts are $ {\it limit} $, $ {\it continuity} $, and $ {\it differentiation} $.

## What is Calculus and used for?

The formal study of calculus started from the 17th century by well-known scientists and mathematicians Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. Calculus is a mathematical discipline that is primarily concerned with functions, limits, derivatives, integrals and infinite series. The emphasis is understanding concepts. The most fundamental concept in calculus is limit.
