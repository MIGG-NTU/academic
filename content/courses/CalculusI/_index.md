The calculus is the branch of mathematics studying the rate of change of quantities (which can be interpreted as slopes of curves) and the length, area, and volume of objects. The calculus is sometimes divided into differential and integral calculus, concerned with derivatives $$ \frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}x}f(x) \quad $$ and and integrals $$ \int {f(x)} \,{\rm d}x $$ respectively. In Calculus I, we mainly discuss differential calculus and the most important concepts are $ {\it limit} $, $ {\it continuity} $, and $ {\it differentiation} $.
