We develope advanced numerical schemes to solve partial differential equations such as the eikonal equations and acoustic/elastic/visoelasitc wave equations to accurately model the propagation of seismic waves in complex media.

Mathematical inverse problems are some of the most important problems in science and engineering. An inverse problem is the process of investigating from a set of indirect measurements the causal factors that produced them. Such situations are common in many application areas such as underground prospecting, medical imaging, non-destructive testing, computer vision, machine learning, data mining, and other fields. We develop new mathematical technology to solve inverse problems in earth sciences.
