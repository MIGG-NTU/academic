Exploration geophysics is an applied branch of geophysics. It aims to explore the first few kilometers of the earth's crust by identifying rock and/or fuild types and structures. The ability to do this is very invaluable in the exploration for oil and gas, and in the mining and construction industries. Full waveform inversion is a recent hot topic in seismic exploration. We have special interests in conducting full waveform modelling and imaging studies of hydraulic fracturing for unconventional oil & gas exploration.
