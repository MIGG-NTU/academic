The formal study of calculus started from the 17th century by well-known scientists and mathematicians Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. Calculus is a mathematical discipline that is primarily concerned with functions, limits, derivatives, integrals and infinite series. The emphasis is understanding concepts. The most fundamental concept in calculus is limit.\n   The Precise Definition of a Limit Let $ f(x) $ be a function defined on some open interval that contains $ a $, except possibly at $ a $ itself. Then we say that the limit of $ f(x) $ as $ a $ approaches $ a $ is $ L $, and we write $$ \\underset{x\\rightarrow a}\\lim f(x)=L $$ if for every number $ ϵ \u0026gt; 0 $ there is a number $ δ \u0026gt; 0 $ such that $$ \\text{if}\\quad 0\u0026lt;|x-a|\u0026lt;\\delta\\quad\\text{then}\\quad|f(x)-L|\u0026lt;\\epsilon $$\n   Continuity Let $ f $ be a function and let $ a\\in\\mathbb{R} $. The function $ f $ is said to be continuous at the point $ a $ if the following three things are true:\n $ f (a) $ is defined (that is, $ a $ is in the domain of $ f $.) The limit $ \\underset{x\\rightarrow a}\\lim f(x) $ exists. $ \\underset{x\\rightarrow a}\\lim f(x)=f(a) $   Derivative The derivative of a function $ f $ at a number $ a $, denoted by $ f'(a) $, is $$ f'(a)=\\underset{h\\rightarrow 0}\\lim\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} $$ if this limit exists.\nMIT Mathematics  Calculus is the study of how things change.

Affected by the Cenozoic orogeny, a large volume of magmatic and metamorphic rocks developed in the ARSZ, forming many orogenic gold deposits.

To gain a basic understanding of the subsurface magmatic activity, we deployed a dense array of 24 broadband seismic stations across the Daping and Chang'an gold deposits at the southern end of the ARSZ. Receiver function analysis, common conversion point stacking, and a joint inversion of receiver functions and surface wave dispersions are performed to image the detailed structure of the crust and uppermost mantle. Low-velocity zones in the mid-lower crust and thinned lithosphere (∼70 km) are imaged under the ARSZ. The observed subsurface structures are verified by 3D numerical modeling with the SEM-FK method.

More than half of the PmP travel times are picked from earthquakes after the 2019 Mw 7.1 Ridgecrest earthquake. Such abundant PmP travel times significantly improve the resolution of the lower crust. Our final velocity model reveals a prominent low-velocity body sitting right beneath the CVF at 5–20 km depths, which we interpret as a rhyolite magma reservoir that supplies heat flux to the hot springs and also feeds the volcanic activities at Coso. We find that the upper-middle crustal low-velocity body dips southwards into the lower crust, extending to regions beneath the Indian Wells Valley and the Garlock Fault at depth greater than 20 km. We ascribe the lower crustal low-velocity body (more than 4% Vp reduction) to a basaltic magma reservoir that connects the melts in the uppermost mantle with the eruptible rhyolitic reservoir at shallower depths. The basaltic magma reservoir constitutes an important part of a continuous N-S elongated crustal magma plumbing system beneath the CVF, formed as a combined result of local extension, faulting, and stress distribution.","tags":[],"title":"Elongated Magma Plumbing System Beneath the Coso Volcanic Field, California, Constrained by Seismic Reflection Tomography","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jing chen","Guoxu Chen","Hao Wu","Jiayuan Yao","Ping Tong"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1652659200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639039472,"objectID":"3283004ed866ca77f3dbf01dab06f5d8","permalink":"https://MIGG-NTU.github.io/academic/publication/2022-srl-chen/","publishdate":"2021-05-16T08:44:32.534389Z","relpermalink":"/academic/publication/2022-srl-chen/","section":"publication","summary":"We present the wave equation‐based adjoint tomography of northeastern Japan using common‐source double‐difference travel‐time data.

In comparison with commonly used travel‐time data, the common‐source double‐difference travel times are insensitive to source parameters and source‐side structures but place enhanced constraints on receiver‐side structures. As a result, these robust double‐difference travel times generate a reliable VP model down to a depth of 120 km. Our inversion results clearly show crustal low‐velocity anomalies beneath the volcanic arc. The subducting Pacific slab is illuminated as a landward‐dipping high‐velocity anomaly, and the arc magmatism in the mantle wedge is shown as low‐velocity anomalies. Thanks to the newly operated Seafloor Observation Network (S‐net), prominent high‐velocity bodies are detected in the fore‐arc mantle wedge at depths of 30–60 km. These abnormal high‐VP bodies indicate a low degree of serpentinization in the fore‐arc mantle wedge at low temperatures, correlating well with the previous finding that the uppermost mantle in the Kuril and Tohoku fore‐arc is cold and dry.

High Vp and high Vp/Vs ratio (1.8) structures of the mid-lower crust beneath the Salton Trough possibly reflect the underplated gabbroic rocks as a result of the extension-induced partial melting of the upwelling asthenospheric materials. The fast velocity directions (FVDs) generally correlate with the direction of the maximum horizontal compressive stress except that fault-parallel FVDs are found at main fault traces. However, the FVDs in the Salton Trough show complex features. The northern Slaton Trough basin (the northern Salton Sea basin and Coachella Valley basin) is dominated by NW-SE FVDs, which are possibly due to the active compression happening there. E-W oriented FVDs predominate the upper crust of the southern Salton Trough basin (the southern Salton Sea basin and Imperial Valley basin), possibly due to faulting and/or block rotation. As the depth increases (12–18 km), the FVDs to the south of the Salton Sea have an overall rotation and gradually become NW-SE. The depth-dependent variation of anisotropy orientation may be attributed to a large band of underlying heat source that probably causes a change of stress field by imposing thermal stress on overlying rocks.

Despite some exciting successes in automatic picking of the first P- and S-wave arrivals, auto-identification of later seismic phases such as the Moho-reflected PmP waves remains a significant challenge in matching the performance of experienced analysts. The main difficulty of machine-identifying PmP waves is that the identifiable PmP waves are rare, making the problem of identifying the PmP waves from a massive seismic database inherently unbalanced. In this work, by utilizing a high-quality PmP data set (10,192 manual picks) in southern California, we develop PmPNet, a deep-neural-network-based algorithm to automatically identify PmP waves efficiently; by doing so, we accelerate the process of identifying the PmP waves. PmPNet applies similar techniques in the machine learning community to address the unbalancement of PmP datasets. The architecture of PmPNet is a residual neural network (ResNet)-autoencoder with additional predictor block, where encoder, decoder, and predictor are equipped with ResNet connection. We conduct systematic research with field data, concluding that PmPNet can efficiently achieve high precision and high recall simultaneously to automatically identify PmP waves from a massive seismic database. Applying the pre-trained PmPNet to the seismic database from January 1990 to December 1999 in southern California, we obtain nearly twice more PmP picks than the original PmP data set, providing valuable data for other studies such as mapping the topography of the Moho discontinuity and imaging the lower crust structures of southern California.","tags":[],"title":"Deep Neural Networks for Creating Reliable PmP Database With a Case Study in Southern California","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiayuan Yao","Shucheng Wu","Tianjue Li","Yiming Bai","Xiao Xiao","Judith Hubbard","Yu Wang","Myo Thant","Ping Tong"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1647561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1655801072,"objectID":"194b798ea858b297c1436de1cf16afd7","permalink":"https://MIGG-NTU.github.io/academic/publication/2022-srl-yao/","publishdate":"2021-03-18T08:44:32.534389Z","relpermalink":"/academic/publication/2022-srl-yao/","section":"publication","summary":"Myanmar occupies a complex region in the active Indo‐Burma subduction system. To illuminate the upper 10 km crustal structure of central Myanmar and obtain new insight into the subduction system, we jointly use P‐wave polarizations and receiver functions (RFs) to construct a high‐resolution VS profile based on a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. This obtained profile clearly delineates six tectonic units and their boundaries, including the Indo‐Burman ranges (IBR), the IBR‐fore‐arc basin boundary, the fore‐arc basin, the volcanic arc, the back‐arc basin, and the Sunda plate. The Sunda plate has relatively higher upper crustal VS (3.0 km/s) and thinner sedimentary cover (∼1 km) compared with the Central Myanmar basin in the Burma plate. The fore‐arc basin, containing thick sediments (10 km), and the back‐arc basin, with thinner sediments (∼1–6 km), are separated by a region with higher VS (∼3.0 km/s), which represents crystallized magma beneath the volcanic arc. A narrow zone of relatively high‐VS (∼2.6–2.7 km/s) ophiolites is situated between the fore‐arc basin and the IBR.

We also find a gradual transition from the lower crust to the uppermost mantle beneath the western Peninsular Ranges, leading to the rareness of pickable PmP waves as well as weak Moho-converted signals there.","tags":[],"title":"Moho Complexity in Southern California Revealed by Local PmP and Teleseismic Ps Waves","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kai Wang","Yi Wang","Xin Song","Ping Tong","Qinya Liu","Yingjie Yang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639376850,"objectID":"6b513b857dd56a599a24e88a3121c23b","permalink":"https://MIGG-NTU.github.io/academic/publication/2021-bssa-wang/","publishdate":"2021-12-13T06:27:30.294861Z","relpermalink":"/academic/publication/2021-bssa-wang/","section":"publication","summary":"Teleseismic full‐waveform inversion has recently been applied to image subwavelength‐scale lithospheric structures (typically a few tens of kilometers) by utilizing hybrid methods in which an efficient solver for the 1D background model is coupled with a full numerical solver for a small 3D target region. Among these hybrid methods, the coupling of the frequency–wavenumber technique with the spectral element method is one of the most computationally efficient ones. However, it is normally based on a single plane‐wave incidence, and thus cannot synthesize secondary global phases generated at interfaces outside the target area. To remedy the situation, we propose to use a multiple plane‐wave injection method to include secondary global phases in the hybrid modeling. We investigate the performance of the teleseismic full‐waveform inversion based on single and multiple plane‐wave incidence through an application in the western Pyrenees and compare it with previously published images and the inversion based on a global hybrid method. In addition, we also test the influence of Earth’s spherical curvature on the tomographic results. Our results demonstrate that the teleseismic full‐waveform inversion based on a single plane‐wave incidence can reveal complex lithospheric structures similar to those imaged using a global hybrid method and is reliable for practical tomography for small regions with an aperture of a few hundred kilometers. However, neglecting the Earth’s spherical curvature and secondary phases leads to errors on the recovered amplitudes of velocity anomalies (e.g., about 2.8% difference for density and VS, and 4.2% for VP on average). These errors can be reduced by adopting a spherical mesh and injecting multiple plane waves in the frequency–wavenumber‐based hybrid method.

The velocity heterogeneities under different geological units are well resolved. The thickness of the low-velocity sediment at the Great Valley Sequence is estimated to be about 10 km. The high-velocity anomaly underlying Great Valley probably indicates the existence of ophiolite bodies. Strong velocity contrasts are revealed across the Hayward Fault (2–9 km) and San Andreas Fault (2–12 km). In the upper crust (2–9 km), the fast velocity directions (FVDs) are generally fault-parallel in the northern Coast Range, which may be caused by geological structure; while the FVDs are mainly NE–SW in Great Valley and the northern Sierra Nevada possibly due to the regional maximum horizontal compressive stress. In contrast, seismic anisotropy in the mid-lower crust (12–22 km) may be attributed to the alignment of mica schists. The anisotropy contrast across the San Andreas Fault may imply different mechanisms of crustal deformation on the two sides of the fault. Both the strong velocity contrasts and the high angle (∼45° or above) between the FVDs and the strikes of faults suggest that the faults are mechanically weak in the San Francisco bay area (2–6 km).

Both applications to practical field data sets and synthetic checkerboard tests demonstrate the advantage of the alternating inversion over individual inversions as it combines the complementary sensitivities of the two independent data sets toward a more unified model. The three dimensional model from our alternating inversion not only shows major features of velocity anomalies and discontinuities in agreement with previous studies, but also reveals small-scale heterogeneities which provide new constraints on the geometry of the Isabella Anomaly and mantle dynamic processes in central California.

Traveltime tomography is then formulated as an optimization problem constrained by the anisotropic eikonal equation, which is subsequently solved by the adjoint-state method. Ray tracing is not required. Its high accuracy is achieved by solving the anisotropic eikonal equation and the associated adjoint equation with efficient numerical solvers. In addition, an eikonal equation-based earthquake location method for azimuthally anisotropic media is developed to solve the coupled hypocenter-velocity problem. The tomography and earthquake location methods are applied to central California near Parkfield to test their performance in practice. A total of 1,068,850 first P-wave traveltimes clearly maps the velocity heterogeneity and azimuthal anisotropy in the upper and middle crust. The average P-wave velocity model shows a striking velocity contrast across the San Andreas Fault (SAF). In the upper crust, we find structural anisotropy in the SAF zone and stress-induced anisotropy off the SAF zone. In the middle crust, the fast P-wave velocity directions are generally fault-parallel due to the decreased effect of the maximum horizontal compressive stress.

In this study, we have developed a teleseismic full waveform inversion (TFWI) method based on the frequency-wavenumber spectral element method (FK-SEM) hybrid to improve the resolution of teleseismic P-waves in the crust. We used the TFWI method to study the crustal velocity by using two large teleseismic events recorded by 29 portable stations with ~5 km intervals across the Zhenghe-Dapu Fault (ZDF) in the Cathaysia Block. This is the first attempt using the FK-SEM hybrid on real data. As expected, we obtained a 2D velocity model in the crust that had high lateral resolution. There is an obvious low velocity zone (LVZ) in the crust below east side of the ZDF, while a relatively high velocity anomaly exits within its west side. Combined with previous geochemical and geological results, this LVZ is explained as remnant magma due to the large-scale magmatism in the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous.

Additionally, the slab exhibits a sinusoidal shape with a low degree of curvature. Our tomographic results also reveal that the maximum penetration depth of the subducted slab increases from the north to south. The subducted slab beneath the northern tip of Sumatra barely arrives at the 410-km discontinuity, while the slab in the south penetrates to a depth of at least 660 km. Our inversion further indicates that the subducted slab is characterized by a tear at a depth of 120 km between 0° N and 2° N, which may be closely related to the supervolcanic eruption of the Toba caldera in northern Sumatra during the Pleistocene. Moreover, we report that the dip of the subducted slab varies significantly (i.e., dramatically decreases) across the Sunda Strait; therefore, we infer that another subvertical slab tear exists beneath the Sunda Strait.","tags":["Seismic tomography","Indo-Australian plate","Sunda plate","Sumatra","Subduction"],"title":"The Geometry of the Subducted Slab Beneath Sumatra Revealed by Regional and Teleseismic Traveltime Tomography","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" July 24, 2020: Nanyang Technological University (Singapore) are accepting applications for 2-3 Research Fellow (Postdoc) positions in computational geophysics and seismology.

It can get better-resolved models by solving full wave equations to accurately simulate the propagation of seismic waves, and by considering full waveform information in inversion. However, the computational cost and storage requirement of 3-D adjoint tomography are high. Relatively, 2-D adjoint tomography is much more computationally efficient. Surface waves and teleseismic body waves provide essential data for studying crustal and uppermost mantle structures. Due to different sensitivities to shear wave velocity at depths and Moho discontinuity, joint inversion of both datasets can resolve the Vs model and Moho interface better. To take advantages of the two different types of data, we propose a strategy of joint inversion for ambient noise surface waves and teleseismic body waves recorded by linear arrays based on the adjoint-state method, which can be used to yield a fine Vs model and Moho topography. We perform various synthetic imaging experiments, in which the model has typical features of crustal structures in North China Craton (NCC). Compared to the surface wave inversion only, joint inversion improves the resolution of images as well as constraining discontinuity undulations better. Compared to the body wave inversion only, joint inversion can suppress high frequency artifacts and reduce the nonlinearity during inversion. This study could provide an efficient alternative to image fine velocity structures beneath linear arrays and also build a framework for joint inversion. It could improve the resolution of lithospheric imaging and also provide strategies of incorporating other waveforms in the future.\n","tags":["Adjoint tomogramphy","Ambient noise","Teleseismic body wave","Joint inversion","Seismic linear array"],"title":"Joint inversion of linear array ambient noise surface-wave and teleseismic body-wave data based on an adjoint-state method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jing Chen","Hao Jing","Ping Tong","Hao Wu","Dinghui Yang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639375442,"objectID":"8fa114b23ec81767d81ef38baf900bc0","permalink":"https://MIGG-NTU.github.io/academic/publication/2020-chen-jcp/","publishdate":"2021-12-13T06:04:02.008944Z","relpermalink":"/academic/publication/2020-chen-jcp/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper introduces the auxiliary function method, a novel, fast and simple approach for waveform based earthquake location. From any initial hypocenter and origin time, we can construct the auxiliary function, whose zero set contains the real earthquake hypocenter and the origin time.

The computational cost of constructing the auxiliary functions is close to the cost of one single iteration of the traditional iterative method. And the cost of searching the common zeros of the auxiliary functions is almost negligible. Thus, the overall cost of this new method is significantly less than that of the iterative methods. Moreover, there is only one common zero point of the auxiliary functions in most practical situations. This means that the new method only requires one round of calculation to obtain an accurate earthquake hypocenter and origin time from arbitrary initial values.

These structures which are critical for better understanding of the geodynamics and evolution of the deep Earth, need to be further resolved by high-resolution imaging techniques. The spectral-element method (SEM) can be used to accurately simulate seismic wave propagation in heterogeneous Earth models, and its application in full-waveform inversion (FWI) provides a promising high-resolution and high-fidelity imaging technique. But it can be computationally prohibitive when used to model small scale structures in the deep Earth based upon high-frequency seismic waves. The heavy computational cost can be circumvented by using hybrid methods, which restrict the main computation by SEM solver to only a small target region (e.g. above the CMB) encompassing possible 2-D/3-D anomalies, and apply efficient analytical or numerical methods to calculate the wavefield for 1-D background models. These forward modelling tools based on hybrid methods can be then used in the so-called ‘box tomography’ approach to resolve fine-structures in the deep Earth.\nIn this study, we outline the theory of a hybrid method used to model small scale structures in the deep Earth and present its implementation based on SEM solvers in a three-step workflow. First, the wavefield generated by the source is computed for the 1-D background model with traction and velocity saved for the virtual boundary of the target region, which are then used as boundary inputs to simulate the wavefield in the target region based on absorbing boundary condition in SEM. In the final step, the total wavefield at receivers is reconstructed based upon the total wavefield on the virtual boundary computed in the previous step. As a proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate the workflow of the hybrid method based on a 2-D SEM solver. Examples of the hybrid method applied to a coupled fluid–solid model show that our workflow can accurately recover the scattered waves back to the surface. Furthermore, we benchmark the hybrid method on a realistic heterogeneous Earth model built from AK135-F and show how teleseismic scattered waves can be used to model deep Earth structures. By documenting the theory and SEM implementation of the hybrid method, our study lays the foundation for future two-way coupling of 3-D SEM solver with other efficient analytic or numerical 1-D solvers.","tags":[""],"title":"High-frequency seismic wave modelling of the deep Earth based on hybrid methods and spectral-element simulations: a conceptual study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shaolin Liu","Iman Suardi","Ming Zheng","Dinghui Yang","Xueyuan Huang","Ping Tong"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1571184000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571184000,"objectID":"cc9cc2d288ac688706eb5791a6f2563e","permalink":"https://MIGG-NTU.github.io/academic/publication/2019-jgr-liu/","publishdate":"2019-10-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/academic/publication/2019-jgr-liu/","section":"publication","summary":"An eikonal equation‐based tomography method is used to invert the high‐quality regional and teleseismic traveltime data recorded by 26 broadband seismic stations in northern Sumatra, following which we obtain the P and S wave velocity structures of the crust and mantle down to a depth of 800 km.

Rather than mapping the velocity perturbation $ Δc(x) = c(x) − c_0(x) $ on only one regular/collocated grid as many previous studies did, we obtain individual Δc(x) models on multiple grids and generate several updated velocity models during one iteration. The average of all the updated velocity models is considered to be the input model of the next iteration. Different grids should partially/fully shift from each other and/or have different grid spacings to form the multiple-grid model parametrization. The efficacy of the multiple-grid model parametrization is demonstrated through the practical example of imaging the P-wave velocity structure along the San Jacinto fault, which is one of the most seismically active faults in California. A series of synthetic recovery examples shows that the multiple-grid model parametrization generally has a better or comparable performance in capturing the heterogeneous subsurface structures than a collocated grid. The root mean square values of the traveltime residuals in the final tomographic models obtained with the multiple-grid model parametrization are smaller than those with collocated grids. Tomographic results reveal strong heterogeneities in the crust along the San Jacinto fault. Significant velocity contrasts are observable across the fault at shallow depths. A low-velocity anomaly dominates the trifurcation area of the San Jacinto fault from the middle crust to the lower crust. Relatively large earthquakes occurred at the boundaries of low-velocity structures but with high-velocity anomalies nearby.

The main contribution of this paper consists of three aspects: (1) We derive the FGA formulation for the 3-D elastic wave equation. Rather than standard ray-based methods (e.g. geometric optics and Gaussian beam method), the derivation requires to do asymptotic expansion in the week sense (integral form) so that one is able to perform integration by parts. Compared to the FGA theory for acoustic wave equation, the calculations in the derivation are much more technically involved due to the existence of both P and S waves, and the coupling of the polarized directions for SH and SV waves. In particular, we obtain the diabatic coupling terms for SH and SV waves, with the form closely connecting to the concept of Berry phase that is intensively studied in quantum mechanics and topology (Chern number). The accuracy and parallelizability of the FGA algorithm is illustrated by comparing to the spectral element method for 3-D elastic wave equation in homogeneous media. (2) We derive the interface conditions of FGA for 3-D elastic wave equation based on an Eulerian formulation and the Snell’s law. We verify these conditions by simulating high-frequency elastic wave propagation in a 1-D layered Earth model. In this example, we also show that it is natural to apply the FGA algorithm to geometries with non-Cartesian coordinates.

We introduce the averaged medium scheme into the TSOS method to further increase its capability of dealing with heterogeneous media and match the boundary-modified scheme for implementing free-surface boundary conditions and the auxiliary differential equation complex frequency-shifted perfectly matched layer (ADE CFS-PML) non-reflecting boundaries with the TSOS method.

Subsequently, we focus on the calculation of synthetic seismograms for teleseismic P or Swaves entering and propagating in the local heterogeneous region of interest. To improve the computational efficiency, we successfully combine the TSOS method with the frequency-wavenumber (FK) method and apply the ADE CFS-PML to absorb the scattered waves caused by the regional heterogeneity. The TSOS-FK hybrid method is benchmarked against semi-analytical solutions provided by the FK method for a 1-D layered model. Several numerical experiments, including a vertical cross-section of the Chinese capital area crustal model, illustrate that the TSOS-FK hybrid method works well for modelling waves propagating in complex heterogeneous media and remains stable for long-time computation.

This method is an extension of the 2D nearly analytic central difference (NACD) method for solving the 3D acoustic wave equation. The 3D NACD method has fourth‐order accuracies both in time and space with only a three‐point stencil in each axis direction. Theoretical properties such as the stability criterion and the numerical dispersion relation were analyzed in detail. Relative to the fourth‐order Lax–Wendroff correction method and the fourth‐order staggered‐grid finite‐difference method, the 3D NACD method exhibits better performance in suppressing numerical dispersion. This was numerically confirmed by simulation of seismic‐wave propagation in different models. Additionally, the 3D NACD method explicitly calculates the spatial gradients of the propagating wavefield, allowing a direct route to sensitivity kernel calculation. Using this method, waveform kernels and travel‐time kernels for direct arrival, single reflected phase, multiple reflected phase, and headwave are computed in a crust‐over‐mantle model. Numerical examples reveal that sensitivity kernel computation based on solving the full‐wave equation can accurately capture the interactions between wavefields and the Earth’s interior heterogeneous structures, and hence generate high‐accuracy sensitivity kernels for the subsequent tomographic inversion. Overall, the proposed method showed good performances for both forward‐modeling and sensitivity kernel calculation. This suggests that the 3D NACD method could serve as an efficient and accurate forwarding‐modeling tool for wave‐equation‐based seismic tomography.","tags":[""],"title":"3D Nearly Analytic Central Difference Method for Computation of Sensitivity Kernels of Wave‐Equation‐Based Seismic Tomography","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ping Tong","Dinghui Yang","Qinya Liu","Xu Yang","Jerry M.

To accurately calculate the travel-time residual $ Δt $, two automatic arrival-time picking techniques including the envelop energy ratio method and the combined ray and cross-correlation method are then developed to compute the arrival times Tsyn for synthetic seismograms. The arrival times $ T^{obs} $ of observed seismograms are usually determined by manual hand picking in real applications. Travel-time sensitivity kernel $ K(x) $ is constructed by convolving a~forward wavefield $ u(t,x) $ with an adjoint wavefield $ q(t,x) $. The calculations of synthetic seismograms and sensitivity kernels rely on forward modeling. To make it computationally feasible for tomographic problems involving a large number of seismic records, the forward problem is solved in the two-dimensional (2-D) vertical plane passing through the source and the receiver by a high-order central difference method. The final model is parameterized on 3-D regular grid (inversion) nodes with variable spacings, while model values on each 2-D forward modeling node are linearly interpolated by the values at its eight surrounding 3-D inversion grid nodes. Finally, the tomographic inverse problem is formulated as a regularized optimization problem, which can be iteratively solved by either the LSQR solver or a~nonlinear conjugate-gradient method.

The NAID method is an alternative numerical modeling method for generating synthetic seismograms. The acoustic wave equation is first transformed into a system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with respect to time variable t, and then directly integrated at a small time interval of [tn, tn+1] to obtain semi-discrete ordinary differential equations. The integral kernel is expanded into a truncated Taylor series, to which the integration operator is explicitly applied. The high-order temporal derivatives involved in the integral kernel are replaced by high-order spatial derivatives, which then are approximately calculated as a weighted linear combination of the displacement, the particle-velocity, and their spatial gradients. In this article, we investigate the theoretical properties of the revised NAID method, including the discrete error and the stability criteria. Numerical results for constant and layered velocity models show that, comparing to the Lax–Wendroff correction (LWC) scheme and the staggered-grid finite difference method, the NAID method can effectively suppress the numerical dispersion and source-noises caused by the discretization of the acoustic wave equation with too-coarse spatial grids or when models have strong velocity contrasts between adjacent layers.
